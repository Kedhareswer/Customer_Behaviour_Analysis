# Customer Segmentation using Agglomerative Clustering and PCA

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using advanced analytical techniques such as Agglomerative Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By analyzing customer data, we aim to uncover distinct patterns and group customers based on their spending habits, income, and other key characteristics. The insights derived from this analysis can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies and tailor their offerings to specific customer segments.

## Methodology
### Exploring Optimal Clusters:
To determine the optimal number of clusters, we calculated the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different numbers of clusters. The analysis revealed that the WCSS values were lower for k=2, indicating two optimal clusters. We then applied the Agglomerative Clustering model with 2 clusters to the dataset.

### Visualizing Insights:
Visualizing the clusters through scatterplots allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of customer segments. By examining variables such as expenses, income, marital status, number of children, and customer age, distinct patterns within each cluster were uncovered. For example, Cluster 1 comprised customers with lower expenses, married with more than 3 kids, and lower income, while Cluster 2 represented customers with higher expenses, often single or with fewer children, and higher income. Age also played a role, with older customers falling into Cluster 2.

## Implications for Businesses
Identifying distinct customer segments enables businesses to tailor their products, services, and marketing efforts to better meet the needs and preferences of each group. Understanding the characteristics and behaviors of different customer segments allows businesses to optimize their targeting strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive growth.
